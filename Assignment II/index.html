but the cool part was that he was a pioneer of early fantasy digital art! He has also been an artist for Dungeons and Dragons 
in general -- his work is fantastical, has amazing composition, and draws you into each setting he paints for. Culturally important

traditionally painted fantasy art. His work has made remarkable commercial success despite the niche genre of fantasy art.
