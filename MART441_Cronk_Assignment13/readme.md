This was a super challenging assignment! I followed along with the tutorial, and had some help from chatGPT with figuring out how to do th extra stuff mentioned in the homework assignment. I used it to help me place a spike trap, though in my case it was a horizontal spike ball. It did help me figure out how to implement it, but there are some bugs that I am dissatisfied with -- I've noticed when using chatGPT, it can sneak in unwanted changes into the code, which down the line can mess a lot of stuff up. I also used chat gpt to help me create a game over restart functionality.

Chatgpt was helpful in trying to understand why my spikeball wasn't behaving the way I wanted it to -- though, again as I said, there were some issues with the code generation. I think my experience this week with chatGPT is a reminder to triple check what it generates and be certain it doesn't cause unnecessary issues.
