And yet… a new reality greets you. You can’t explain it—it feels like no dream you’ve ever had before. It’s too… real, too visceral. You blink, urging yourself to spirit away from this place, but here you are… and here you remain.You stand in a wasteland, colours of gold and rust sweeping out into rocky towers and glittering dunes. You can feel the cold, feel the deep chill that soaks into your muscles and strains against your joints. The wind is strong, kicking up dust around your feet, deep wells of sand forming around your ankles. In the sky hangs a blacked-out sun, a fiery, red gradient pulsing from behind the eclipse, casting the ground beneath it in an eerie, half-glow. Beyond the deep, mournful howl of the wind, you hear nothing else. You see nothing else of interest…",

Maybe even a way out of this hellscape, and back to the comfort and warmth of your bed. A minute turns to several, and still, nothing—nothing of note, nothing new; you begin to feel the sweat of nervousness, the balking of your mind as you refuse to accept that you are, in fact, here. Minutes turn to hours… and you notice that the eclipse, which should have dissipated by now, remains, a steadfast herald of whatever mystery you’ve found yourself enthralled to. When you begin to lose hope, to feel yourself break down against the pressures of a reality that mystifies you, a small glimmer of hope flickers in the horizon – a light. A small, glowing light—like a campfire. A sign of habitation – a sign you are not alone.",

You see there a woman, gaunt, with ashen grey skin. She shambles, dragging her feet, and her face is contorted into the permanent fixture of a long, gaping scream -- but no sound comes.

You open your mouth to scream, pulling your hands up to your face in fear, but you see it then -- your hands, leathery, old and withered. And your voice does not come. Your eyes glaze over, and sight leaves you, leaves you alone in this desolate place. A dry rattle of laughter comes from the woman, the other you. 'Now we're together again... whole.'",

A hand shoots out from the darkness, and a voice undulates in warbling tones of tinny highs and growling, demonic lows. 'I've been so lonely... I've been so thin... I've been aching to meet you, my twin.' With a gasp, you are pulled within, the singsong whisper lulling you into surrender. You feel a lance of pain travel from collarbone to navel, and the last things you here are the singsong melody, and the wet squelching of your innards.",
