Thoughts on this week's assignment:

I forgot almost everything about HTML and CSS since last spring, but with a little bit of googling, I managed to pick it back up.

I had some issues in getting my Navbar centered -- if I used it as a block or inline block, it wouldn't center. Using flex centered it, but it also narrowed the bar instead of having it go straight across, which was weird. In the end, flex suited my needs however, so I accept it haha. I made a few div classes to break up the page visually, and added some custom fonts. I actually did a mock up of the font combination I wanted to use in Word, just to see how it would look. I uploaded some of my artwork into an images folder, and used one of my pictures as a banner for the top of the page. I struggled a bit trying to size the paintings down to the containers width, but eventually figured it out by creating a div class for it
which used object fit cover and overflow hidden.

 Couldn't remember how to put a title on top of the image, so for now, the headers are below the image and navbar. I would like to learn how to click on an image to blow it up, so the art work can be viewed at a bigger size.
 I created multiple pages in the end because I thought to have all of that on one page may get kind of lengthy, so I hope that's okay!
