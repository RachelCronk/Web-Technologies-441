                                        <img src="images/Dividers+Graphics/Dividers_black_18.png" height="50"><br>
                                        I'm majoring in Media arts with a focus in Video Game Design -- I wish I had had more classes in Game Design, but
                                        when I first enrolled in classes, that wasn't a big option at the time. I'm certainly making up for it now in my final
                                        few semesters. My prior experience in game design started around 2015 -- I have a few game jams under my belt,
                                        and had worked on several full-length games that were never completed due to a partnership falling out. Now, I am
                                        interested in learning how to make games as a solodev, and am very excited to pave my path forwards!
                                        <BR>
                                            <h3>Painting, Pixel Art & More!</h3>
                                        <img src="images/Dividers+Graphics/Dividers_black_18.png" height="50"><br>
                                        My hobbies are wide & varied! I am writing a novel series (with ever-expanding ideas on more stories and characters!)
                                        that is a dark fantasy / horror genre tale. I've been working on it for around 6 years, though the world it is in began
                                        to emerge in my mind around 2011. As previously mentioned, I dabbled in video game design for almost 10 years now -- 
                                        I mostly focused on Pixel Art, however, and started coding last semester. <BR><BR>I enjoy creating pixel art that is so detailed
                                        it doesn't look like pixel art! I try and take a painterly perspective when I make my pixel art, and most of my 
                                        assets are around 256x256, and occassionally 1024x1024. I have experience in making tileables and assets that are 32x32 and 16x16,
                                        but have become more comfortable with the larger 128x128 and larger. <BR><BR>I taught myself animation, and my time in UM has
                                        helped me further that knowledge! I am also a self-taught artist, and expanded upon that in UM as well! I paint--both
                                        traditionally and digitally. I use photoshop to paint! I lean towards landscapes and concept art. I also indulge in 
                                        crafts -- I love to take old bottles and upcycle them into vases, and decopauge paper onto items too! I also enjoy Painting
                                        pots for houseplants!<BR>
                                            <h3>Videogames I play</h3>
                                        <img src="images/Dividers+Graphics/Dividers_black_18.png" height="50"><br>
                            </p>        I really enjoy fantasy RPGs, and have since I was a little kid! It's hard to believe it, but I've been playing
                                        the Original Baldur's Gate 1&2 since I was 11 -- that's 21 years! Because of that experience, I have
                                        sought out fantasy games for most of my adulthood, ranging from TES Oblivion & Skyrim, Pillars of Eternity,
                                        Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights, and just about any fantasy game I can get my hands on!<BR><BR>
                                        Another formative title for me was Half-Life 2 in 2005 (more specifically, the orange box), which introduced me to FPS. Since then,
                                        I have enjoyed a variety of games such as DayZ, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, Sons of the Forest,
                                        Mass Effect, and more!<BR><BR>I also enjoy indie games as well -- Rain World is the most recent Indie Game I've played that 
                                            truly captured me!<BR>
                                                <h3>Free Time</h3>
                                        <img src="images/Dividers+Graphics/Dividers_black_18.png" height="50"><br>
                                        In my (limited) free time, I enjoy cooking, walking my dog, buying my cat new toys,
                                        reading, and watching films! Some of my favourite books are The Lord of The Rings,
                                        Oryx & Crake, The Forgotten Realms Series, and many, many more. I was working my way
                                        through 1984 by George Orwell, and The Stand by Stephen King.
                                        
                                                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                                        <img src="images/Dividers+Graphics/Dividers_black_18.png" height="50"><br>
                                        Phew, that's a dense About Me write up! I'm excited to be in this class and learn more
                                        about CSS and HTML, and tread into new territory with Java! I'm excited to see what 
                                        everyone comes up with this semester!
