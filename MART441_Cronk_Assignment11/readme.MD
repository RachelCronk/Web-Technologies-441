phew, what a fun homework assignment! It was not without some struggling however -- but I used chatGPT to help me figure out some errors with placement of code on my end, and I did use it to figure out how to get the canvas to change colour on impact. It was also instrumental in helping me figure out some issues I had with moving my square 2, and the collision not working when it happened! The collision itself was registering in the console log, but it seemed like the movement of the square fiddled with the blocking of the squares being able to move through each other. ChatGPT really helped me solve that one, I spent an hour or two on it!

It also helped clean up my math random movement for the square, which was nice. It also helped me solve some errors with trying to create a class that square and square2 referenced! It was very instrumental for helping me figure this out, but I'm super excited to be learning all of this! I included and html5 audio change from the tutorials you had as well, and picked some music that complimented the Collide game!
