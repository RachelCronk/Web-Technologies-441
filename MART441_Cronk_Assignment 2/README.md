So, I sort of dislike the idea of using Chat GPT, but I can see the learning benefit. It helps me see how it is styling everything,
and shows me new ways to approach my own coding. The benefit is that you can get the results almost immediately as well. It was my first
time using the site, as I try to avoid AI stuff if possible, for personal preference. My prompt wasn't as detailed as my own site coding was, but it did show me how to approach it.

If I only used AI output rather than learning myself, it would feel cheap -- I'd feel like *I* didn't do anything, and would not want to share it. There is no allure for me to use AI in place of my own brain, creativity, and dedication.

If looking at the chat gpt site, I could explain what was going on, but again, I wouldn't feel comfortable using it in place of my own work.

As a final note -- no, if you use AI, the work is not yours, which is a source of contention for many ai generators. On the site Threads, I've been ridiculed and belittled because I happen to believe that AI art is not, in fact, art. I've heard every sort of argument, and had people be incredibly mean to defend their perspective. I say just simply, you yourself did not make it. A machine did, for you, and for you to claim it as your own formula, art, or product is disingenuous. Art is something that takes time, patience, and acquired skill through learning. For someone to forgo all that to attempt to receive the praise an artist gets feels... lame, to put it mildly. It tells me that they don't have the patience or want to actually learn something and cultivate a skill. Most artists, probably about 99%, did not start out good - it took time and effort. So those are my thoughts on that.


As a side note, I put my script code into my index.html, because I couldn't figure out how to get the script to show on my page, and when I used the console log within the script.js, it wasn't highlighted in my code to show that it was working (when a code is working, usually keywords turn different colours) How do I connect the java script page to the index, so that code will show on the home page's console?
