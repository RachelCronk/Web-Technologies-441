This week I used a combination of the example homework and chatgpt to figure out how to structure my class, object, and the corresponding images!

I used the homework as the foundation, setting up the general coding and brickwork. Then, I used chatgpt to help me figure out why my array wouldn't initialize, how to pathways to the images to call them, and how to resize the images so they weren't so big! It was useful to debug, but I didn't have very many problems this week! I also asked chatgpt how to start with a set image before clicking random!

I also went in and added descriptions, and some of the pictures had no dates, so I had to guess. This was a fun project!
